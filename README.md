Movie application

This application was part of a lesson in React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximlian Schwarzmuller.

This is an application that involves both frontend as well as backend.
This application you will need to install npm.
Npm start.
Download and create project in Firebase for backend database.
You will receive an error message if you try to add or fetch movies without Firebase or backend database.


This movie taught me how to add a backend database to applications.
This application involves sending http requests and connecting to backend databases.
This application executed sending post requests for movies.


In this application,  the user can enter a movie title, opening text, release date, and then add the movie.
Once the user adds the movie and hits submit, the movie data will be collected in Firebase.
The add movie handler is triggered after user clicks "Add movie" button.
User can add several movies along with texts, and release dates to the backend Firebase database.
User can then "fetch" added movies by clicking on the "Fetch Movies" button.


Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
